/*! \brief Threshold logic function identification

  Given a truth table, this function finds the lexicographically smallest truth
  table in its NPN class, called NPN representative. Two functions are in the
  same NPN class, if one can obtain one from the other by input negation, input
  permutation, and output negation.


  \param tt The truth table
  \param plf Pointer to a vector that will hold a linear form of `tt` if it is a TF.
             The linear form has `tt.num_vars()` weight values and the threshold value
             in the end.
  \return `true` if `tt` is a TF; `false` if `tt` is a non-TF.
